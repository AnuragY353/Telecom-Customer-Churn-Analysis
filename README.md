# 📌 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company to identify key factors influencing customer retention. Using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**, we uncover insights related to contract types, payment methods, tenure, and demographics to recommend effective retention strategies.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes customer details, contract types, payment methods, tenure, and churn status.
- **Total Customers:** X
- **Features:** Contract type, Payment method, Tenure, Internet service, Demographics, etc.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Key Insights
- 📉 **Contract Type Impact:** Month-to-month contracts have a **42% churn rate**, while yearly and two-year contracts have **11% and 3%**, respectively.
- 💳 **Payment Method Influence:** Customers using **electronic checks churn at 45%**, compared to **15-18% for other methods**.
- ⏳ **Churn by Tenure:** **50% churn rate** for customers with less than a year, decreasing to **15% after 3+ years**.
- 🌐 **Internet Service Type:** **30% churn rate** for Fiber Optic users vs. **20% for DSL users**.
- 👴 **Senior Citizen Churn:** **41% churn rate** among seniors compared to **26% for others**.

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Bar charts & line graphs** for churn trends by contract type & payment method.
- **Heatmaps** to show churn distribution across different groups.
- **Tenure vs. churn rate analysis** for early engagement strategies.

## 🚀 Recommendations
✅ **Encourage long-term contracts** with discounts & benefits.  
✅ **Promote alternative payment methods** (credit card/bank transfer) to reduce electronic check churn.  
✅ **Improve early customer engagement** through onboarding programs.  
✅ **Develop targeted retention plans** for senior citizens & fiber optic users.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Incorporate **machine learning models** to predict churn probability.
- Analyze **customer feedback** to understand dissatisfaction trends.
